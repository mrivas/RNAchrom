There is a revolution in genomics. We are moving from simply studying the DNA as string of nucleotides to exploring its cross-interactions. In this context, RNA-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in chromatin modification, and alternative splicing among other relevant biological processes.

To harvest this type of data, we have developed RNAchrom, a Python package designed to be easy to use by both computational and experimental biologists. 

To start analyzing your data with RNAchrom follow this installation instructions

	:ref:`installation`

As tutorial, we have included detailed application case of RNAchrom here

	:ref:`exampleCase`

Finally, a summary list of all RNAchrom tools are presented here.
